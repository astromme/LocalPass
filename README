LocalPass
=========

LocalPass is a password manager app written using the Chrome packaged app platform. 


Installation
------------

*"Just tell me how to run it already"*

* Install [Chrome Canary][canary-dl]
* Enable "Experimental Extension APIs" in chrome://flags
* Download [this zip of LocalPass][localpass-dl]
* Unzip LocalPass.zip
* On chrome://extensions click the "Enable Developer Mode" checkbox
* Click the "Load unpacked extension..." button and select the app subdirectory of LocalPass
* Run the app from the new tab page

Architecture
------------

LocalPass stores and encrypts the password database locally. No unencrypted data is ever sent to the server, and the server never has the decryption key.
